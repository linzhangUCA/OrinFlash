# OrinFlash
A fork from JetsonHacks to Flash JetPack5.1.3 to a Jetson Orin Nano board.

**NOTEs**: 
- The modified scripts were only tested on a [Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit \[SUB\] 8GB](https://category.yahboom.net/products/jetson-orin-nano) for installing the Jetson Linux 35.5.0. The original scripts may work on other versions of Jetson Linux and different Jetson modules.
